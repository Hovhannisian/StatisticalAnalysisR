#s. Interpret the estimated coefficients, as well as their signs and significance
#b0 is 120.7561, meaning regardless the factors the motel pct will be positive.  0.6326 is the estimate intercept for competitor percentage, meaning in case of each unit increase in it own motel percentage will also increase. Aliigned with th economic logic, the intercept for relative price is negative ( -106.9659), meaning each unit increase in the market price will bring negative effect on the motel occupancy. However, lets note that this factor has comparably low significance on th emodel. And the indicator variable of repair period also has a negative correlation affect on the motel occupancy (-18.1441) being the most significant factor in this model.

#compute an estimate of the revenue lost by the damaged motel during the repair period (215 days @ $56.61 ×𝛽4)
rep_loss = 18.1441*215*56.11
print(rep_loss)
print(lost_rev)
lost_rev-rep_loss
#the estimate lost revenue was less than the loss considering the repair period estimate
